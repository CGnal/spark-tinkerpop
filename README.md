Spark-Tinkerpop
=======

Spark-Tinkerpop is an enrichment library supplementing the [Spark GraphX](http://spark.apache.org/graphx/) framework. While serving as an integration layer with [Apache Tinkerpop](https://tinkerpop.apache.org), it also adds saving and loading functionality against various serialization methods, including Java, Kryo and JSON. 

Quickstart
-------

The main functionality that Spark-Tinkerpop brings to the table revolves around persisting the data generated by GraphX, naturally allowing for incremental graph processing, but also to integrate with other graph processing engines such as Titan, Neo4J and OrientDB.

Graph persistence comes in a few different forms in Spark-Tinkerpop:

#### Java

The simplest way to read and write graph data is of course to use plain Java serialization; this calls for a few considerations on speed and efficiency, as well as backward-compatibility in case the code changes between graph-processing increments.

```scala
...

import org.cgnal.graphe._

...
// save graph at [location]
graph.save(location).asJava
...
// load graph from [location]: Vertices are of type V, Edges are of type E
sparkContext.load[V, E](location).asJava

```
